# StageKit development handoff

Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) first. This file is the current state.

## Where things stand

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Version | 0.1.0 (in `buildspec.json`). First pre-release is `0.1.0-beta1` |
| Repository | https://github.com/TechSavage1989/StageKit (public; visibility verified, not changed) |
| Default branch | `main`, which holds all work so far (pull request #1, merged 2026-11-12) |
| Working branch | None open. Start new work on a `feat/`, `fix/`, `docs/` or `chore/` branch |
| Releases / update feed | GitHub releases on this repository. The plugin has no updater |
| Built against | OBS 31.1.1 (`buildspec.json`). The owner runs OBS 32.2.2 on Windows |

## What is built

All on `main`, each with headless tests on Linux:

- Ramp Blur filter, with Blur All hotkeys and obs-websocket vendor requests
- Ambient Background source
- Shadow & Backdrop filter
- Ramp Zoom filter
- Place Item, Show/Hide Animation, Match Item and Layout scene filters
- StageKit dock (Qt): position grid, one-click keys, saved spots, add-an-effect buttons

## Not verified

- **Nothing has been loaded in OBS on Windows or macOS.** CI compiles there; the shaders are only
  exercised on OpenGL. Direct3D compiles `.effect` files at load time, so the first run on Windows is
  the real test.
- The Windows artifact's folder layout has not been opened and checked.
- Ambient Background's *Automatic* live capture needs the OBS front end and is not covered by tests.
- The dock is tested by building the widget and clicking its buttons without an OBS window. It has not
  been seen docked inside OBS, in OBS's theme, or following scene changes.
- No test uses a real Stream Deck. Filter and Source keys are simulated by flipping the filter's enabled
  state and the item's visibility.
- The README has not been viewed rendered on GitHub.

## Known limitations

- Place Item needs one filter per destination; the dock creates the nine grid ones in one click.
- Scene filters do not list items inside groups.
- Linked visibility (hiding a linked item with its leader) is not built.
- Ramp Zoom has no follow-the-mouse mode.
- Ambient Background cuts, rather than cross-fades, when *Automatic* picks a different capture.
- Show/Hide Animation can show a one-frame gap if a hide lands between a frame's tick and its render.
- Ramp Blur carries its own copy of the on/off-switch logic that `SwitchRamp` now provides, and Ambient
  Background its own copy of the Kawase blur that `KawaseBlur` now provides.

## Still to do

1. A Stream Deck plugin with live key state and dial support. The owner asked for this last.
2. Fold the two duplicated helpers above into the shared ones.
3. A mini map in the dock for dragging items (OBS's own preview already allows dragging).

## Commands

```bash
tests/run-tests.sh
```

```bash
bash scripts/check-root.sh
```

Formatting checks are listed in AGENTS.md. Settings live in the user's OBS scene collection; the plugin
writes no files of its own.

## Exceptions to the shared standard

- **Update checks, the update notice, the download bar and the install dialog do not apply.** StageKit
  is an OBS plugin with no window, executable or updater of its own. Revisit only if the owner asks for
  an update notice inside OBS.
- **No hero image or logo.** The README uses frames rendered by the tests instead of window
  screenshots, because OBS has not been run with a display.
- **`ramp-blur` predates the branch-naming rule** (`feat/`, `fix/`, ...). It is kept because pull
  request #1 is open on it. Use the prefixes for new branches.

## Releasing

Releases publish themselves; nobody pushes a tag by hand.

1. On a branch, add `docs/releases/<version>.md` (for example `0.2.0.md` or `0.2.0-beta1.md`). Bump
   `version` in `buildspec.json` when the base version changes. Merge the pull request.
2. On that push to `main`, `.github/workflows/push.yaml` builds every platform. Its *Find Unpublished
   Release* job takes the newest notes file by version; if no tag of that name exists, *Publish Release*
   creates the tag on that commit and a release with the built files, the notes and SHA-256 checksums.
   Names ending in `-beta` or `-rc` (with an optional number) are published as pre-releases.
3. Check the release page: files present, checksums listed, pre-release flag correct.

An existing tag is never reused or overwritten; to publish again, add a new notes file with a new
version. AI coding sessions cannot push tags or create releases themselves (the platform refuses both),
which is why the repository's own workflow does it. Pushing a version tag by hand still works and goes
through the template's older *Create Release* job, which leaves a draft.

Files released from `main` are built in the `RelWithDebInfo` configuration (optimised, with debug
information), which is what the template uses for pushes to `main`.

## Branches

- No unmerged branches. `ramp-blur` was merged and removed by the branch-cleanup workflow on its first
  run (1 deleted, 0 kept). That run reported failure because of a printing bug with an empty list, fixed
  in the following pull request.

## Task history

- 2026-11-12: Owner supplied the repository and asked for the features above to be built and pushed to
  it. Source was pushed to `ramp-blur` and draft pull request #1 was opened. No approval was given for
  marking the pull request ready, merging, tagging or releasing, so none of those were done. This entry
  is history, not standing permission.
- 2026-11-12: Owner approved merging into `main` and publishing a release. Pull request #1 was marked
  ready and merged after all checks passed. Tagging and publishing are refused for sessions by the platform,
  so an automatic release job was added to the push workflow and the release was published by it. History, not standing permission.
- 2026-11-12: `docs/REPOSITORY_STANDARDS.md` was copied byte-for-byte from the owner's other app
  repositories (nine of them held an identical copy).
